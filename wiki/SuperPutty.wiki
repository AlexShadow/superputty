#summary SuperPutty Introduction

= Introduction =
SuperPutty is a Windows application used primarily as a window manager for the PuTTY SSH Client. It allows you to embed PuTTY terminal instances inside of a windows form providing a better tabbed interface when multiple connections are used.

SuperPutty does not do any ssh or terminal management itself since PuTTY does an excellent job of this.

== Requirements ==
  * A PC running Windows (XP, Vista and Windows 7)
  * The Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or newer
  * 32 and 64 bit operating systems are supported
  * The [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ PuTTY] SSH Client
